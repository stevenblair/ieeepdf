This extension for Google Chrome removes the frame and banner above IEEEXplore PDF files. This makes better use of the vertical screen space and makes IEEXplore tolerable.

To install go to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fixieeepdf/gigbombkfogfombmlobjchidodimgiam

 2. open Chrome
 3. go to Options > Extensions
 4. check `Developer mode`
 5. click on `Load unpacked extension...` and find the repo directory
